	@# tells you the build was fresh; it cannot tell you the artifact in /Applications came from

	@# distinguish "the cache was stale" from "the cache was fine and something else is wrong",
	@# so pulling it lets you skip a diagnosis rather than complete one. Both cargo and Vite key
	@# their caches on content hashes, so a changed file always rebuilds its unit.
	@#
	@# CLEAN=1 exists anyway, because "I want to rule the toolchain out" is a legitimate call to
