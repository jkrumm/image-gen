/**
 * Pure request-construction for the Library's three replay ops (docs/concept.md §2, "Tweak vs
 * Re-run, finally distinct"). Deliberately has no Tauri imports — the file-loading (reading an
 * edit's saved input images off disk) and the actual enqueue/navigation calls live in
 * `Library.tsx`, which is untestable without a Tauri runtime; everything that can be pure, is,
 * so the replay-request shape and (above all) the size-snap chokepoint are pinned by unit tests.
 *
 * The replay hazard (repo CLAUDE.md / the G5 brief): a recorded `params.size` is truthful but not
 * necessarily replayable — gpt-image-2 returns non-16-divisible dimensions for `size: "auto"`
 * (observed live: 1024x1024 in -> 1254x1254 out), and re-sending that 400s upstream. Every
 * function here that turns a saved generation back into a request pipes the size through
 * `snapSizeForModel`, resolving the model first since size validity is per-model.
 *
 * The second replay hazard, since the studio went gpt-image-2-only: a sidecar may name a model
 * that can no longer generate (`gpt-image-1.5`, `gpt-image-1-mini`) and may carry parameters only
 * those models accepted (`background: 'transparent'`, `input_fidelity`). Replaying such a
 * generation must still work end-to-end, so those fields are coerced into a valid gpt-image-2
 * request — but never silently (concept §2's central taboo). Every coercion is returned alongside
 * the request as a `ReplayCoercion` for the caller to surface.
