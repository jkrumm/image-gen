# Gateway's own bearer (clients send this as `Authorization: Bearer <…>`).
# Literal on purpose: localhost dev needs no real secret, and keeping it out of
# 1Password lets `bun run dev` work on the headless mini (cache backend) without
# seeding a prod-tier ref. Prod uses op://vps/image-gen-gateway/API_SECRET (deploy/.env.tpl).

# Telemetry → argo POST /usage/records. ON by default, deliberately: a local dev
# generation spends real IU tokens exactly like a prod one, so leaving it off would
# silently under-report actual spend. Prod posts to argo over the internal
# monitoring-net docker route (deploy/.env.tpl); local has to use the public host.
# Comment both out only if you're deliberately generating throwaway junk.

# Tags every usage record so local spend is distinguishable from the VPS's in argo.
# Defaults to "vps" in env.ts — an unset MACHINE here would mislabel local runs.
