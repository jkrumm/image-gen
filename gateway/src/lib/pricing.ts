/**

 * not image models: they never emit `input_tokens_details`, and they must never
 * leak into `IMAGE_MODELS`.
 *
 * Without an entry here `computeCost` returned `{ usd: null }` for every plan,
 * which argo renders as $0 — that silently hid ~76% of this service's token
 * volume until 2026-07-24.
 *
 * `gpt-5.6` is an **alias**, not a model: `/v1/models` on our endpoint lists only
 * `-sol`/`-terra`/`-luna`, and a live probe (2026-07-24) showed a request for
 * `gpt-5.6` comes back with `"model": "gpt-5.6-sol"` — so it is priced at sol's
 * rate. Vendor docs claim no bare `gpt-5.6` exists at all; the endpoint disagrees.
 * If the planner's cost ever looks off by an integer factor, re-probe first — the
 * alias could be re-pointed at another tier without notice.
 *
 * Rates below are measured 2026-09-13 against the IU unified endpoint's own
 * `usage.cost`, USD per 1M tokens, superseding the earlier vendor-page-derived
 * figures (`gpt-5.6-luna` was wrongly $1/$6; `deepseek-v4.1-flash` was wrongly
 * $0.30/$1.20 with no cached rate) — see
 * modelpick/docs/decisions/model-configs.md. `glm-5.3-flash` is not
 * `ENHANCE_MODEL` today but priced here so a future switch (or a historical
 * row) doesn't silently report `usd: null`.
